// "chunked" format before writing them to w. Closing the returned chunkedWriter
// sends the final 0-length chunk that marks the end of the stream but does
// not send the final CRLF that appears after trailers; trailers and the last
// CRLF must be written separately.
//
// NewChunkedWriter is not needed by normal applications. The http
// package adds chunking automatically if handlers don't set a
// Content-Length header. Using newChunkedWriter inside a handler
// would result in double chunking or chunking with a Content-Length
// length, both of which are wrong.
